# composerize-ts

This is a very small tool to convert `docker run/create` commands into (hopefully) working `docker-compose.yml` files.

## CLI

composerize-ts can be run in the cli.

`npm install composerize-ts -g` to install, and run as such:

```bash
$ composerize-ts docker run -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro --restart always --log-opt max-size=1g nginx
```
